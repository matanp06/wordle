## What is wordle
Wordle is "guess the word" game invented by the Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle

## How to win
To win the game you should guess a five letter word within 6 attempts.

## How does it work
At the beginning you have no clues for the currect word.
<br>
To start the game just type a five letter word.
<br>
After each attempt the color of the each used letter in the attempted word 
changed according the following rules:
* Green - the letter is in the word and placed in the currect position.
* Yellow - the letter is in the word but placed in the wrong position.
* Gray - the letter is not in the word.

## To Do next:
- [ ] Fix the keyboard display on moblie devices
- [ ] Change colors for better view of the letters.
- [ ] Add a restart option.
- [ ] Reveal the secret word when the user losed.
